There currently aren't any examples I could find of getting inference working on a tflite model made when converting from YOLOX -> ONNX -> TFlite
Here is a working standalone script, based on the ONNX inference code in YOLOX, feel free to use it!

Just specify your tf model name and test image 

I'm still trying to get inference working on Android (kotlin) so please feel free to contribute
